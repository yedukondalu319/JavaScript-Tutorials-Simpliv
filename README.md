Gaining a profound knowledge of JavaScript first helps you to get going with one of the frameworks fast and easily. Furthermore understanding the core concepts of a scripting language like JavaScript is essential to understand the core concepts of modern web development.

JavaScript is the language of the web. It makes websites interactive, creates animations, draws data-driven graphics, and more. It even runs natively in your web browser so you don’t have to install it and you can get to coding right away. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is an essential language for any aspiring or current web developer.

JavaScript owes much of its versatility and usefulness to its many libraries and frameworks, which are tools that handle a lot of the heavy lifting in web development and coding.
